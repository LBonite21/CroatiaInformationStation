                <h3 style="margin-top: 105px;">Pelegrini</h3>

                    a big seller.
                </p>

                <h3 style="margin-top: 245px;">Dubravkin Put</h3>
                <p id="info-text">Located in the woods a short walk from Zagreb, you'll find Dubravkin Put. It's here
                    that you will find stylish and sophistecated Medditerranean cuisine served to you in style. The

                    experience at theis restaurant even better.
                </p>

                <h3 style="margin-top: 280px;">Monte</h3>
                <p id="info-text">Croatia's one and only Michelin-star restaurant is certainly worth a visit when in
                    Rovinj. Here,
                    you'll experience delightful contemporary Croatian food. Go for the tasting menu and take in the

                    experience. If that's too much, be sure to try the suckling pig, which is to die for.
                </p>

                <h3 style="margin-top: 320px;">Brodetto</h3>
                <p id="info-text">Also called brudet, this fisherman’s stew hails from from Italy’s Marche region.
                    Traditionally, fishermen cooked it over an open fire using the catch of the day. They would add
                    ample vinegar to the pot to preserve the stew for a couple of days. Like Italians, coastal Croatians
                    use a tomato base in this dish.
                </p>

                <h3 style="margin-top: 205px;">Boškarin</h3>
                <p id="info-text">The white-grey, long-horned Istrian oxen are a gourmet delicacy. Boškarin is served at
                    top restaurants and konobas (taverns) in a variety of ways, including as carpaccio; in savoury sauce
                    with pasta or gnocchi; as salami or steak; and boškarin tail soup.
                </p>

                <h3 style="margin-top: 230px;">Istrian Ham</h3>
                <p id="info-text">A good meal frequently begins with a platter of pršut i sir (ham and cheese). Istrian
                    pršut is made of skinned pork leg, which is dry-salted with sea salt and seasoned with natural
                    spices such as pepper and garlic, and sometimes bay leaves and rosemary. Unlike southern coastal
                    Croatia, where Dalmatians smoke their ham, Istrians air-cure their meat with the strong northern
                    wind of the Bura. Istrian ham is aged for at least 12 months, and up to 18 months depending on
                    weather conditions. The resulting product has a special aroma and moderately salty taste, which
                    pairs well with cheeses from the region.
                </p>

                <h3 style="margin-top: 50px;">Malvazija and Teran</h3>
                <p id="info-text">Istria’s signature wine varieties are Malvazija and Teran. Malvazija, an easy-drinking
                    white wine with good minerality and apricot and apple notes, pairs well with seafood dishes. Teran,
                    a robust red, goes well with meat dishes including boškarin and pršut.
                </p>

                <h3 style="margin-top: 200px;">Peka</h3>
                <p id="info-text">Popular throughout Croatia, this tender meat & vegetable dish is also called ispod
                    čripnje (under the bell) – literally food that is cooked under a terracotta or iron lid over burning
                    embers. Peka can include octopus, lamb, veal or chicken, and is often accompanied by potatoes.
